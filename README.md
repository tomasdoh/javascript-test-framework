# Javascript Test Framework

Making a Javascript testing framework from scratch

## Plan

- Test has a name
- Test runs the production code
- Compares the result of production code with expected result
- If fails, show a message
- If passes, show a pass message

* Test runner
- runs in the browser
- needs to load source code
- needs to load test code
- run tests
